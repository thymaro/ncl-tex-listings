# ncl-tex-listings
This is simply a language definition file for NCAR Command Language (NCL) to use with TeX's and LaTeX's listings package.

To use it, just download the `.tex` file, put it next to your main `.tex` document in the same directory and write the following line in your preamble:

    \input{ncl-tex-listings}

If you are using _TeXstudio_ (like I am), hit and hold `Ctrl`, then click on `ncl-tex-listings` (which has now magically morphed into a clickable link) to check, if the file is found. If it isn't, I can think of three error sources
+ you didn't download the file
+ you downloaded the file to another directory than the one you should have. Please check your 'downloads' directory.
+ you changed the name of the file. Why?

Learn how to access the file anyway. Look it up on [tex.se](tex.stackexchange.com) or whatever.

Ok, nuff kiddin'. I know nobody will ever read this. I mean, who on earth uses TeX **and** NCL in one sitting?! You nerds!

Nevertheless, if you see a way to improve on this file, please feel free to fork it and add a pull request.
